Execute the handTrack.py file run the program. It works best with even, mild lighting on a constant, solid 
color background.

The program uses the OpenCV library, as well as a bank of over 6000 contours of
hands that I collected myself, to identify hands in a frame. The hand color must
be measured first and the hand must also be within the rectangular rectangle
on the frame to be detected. There will be a green outline of the hand if it
is recognized by the program. Ensure that the cursor is on another page to
observe the scrolling and zooming effects.

If bugs occur, ensure that the lighting is not too bright or too dim, and move
the hand slowly to ensure that it is always being detected by the program.

Enjoy!
